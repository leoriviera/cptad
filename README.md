# Captive Portals to Another Dimension

Hello! Welcome to the repo for the talk *Captive Portals to Another Dimension*, by Leo Riviera.

> You've connected to a rogue wireless network and the evil Dr. Funktastic has taken your device hostage! Can you escape his captive portal by beating him at his twisted games? This talk explores building a captive wireless access point, and using the terminal for interactive storytelling.

This contains everything you need to get started with the project, including

- the talk's slides,
- a setup script for the Raspberry Pi 4B,
- the React code for the captive portal (`captive-portal`)
